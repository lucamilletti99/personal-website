# Welcome to CSE 298: Software Development Methodologies!

This project is the base for which you will develop your web application over the course of the next 5 weeks with your team members.

As you'll notice, the code is separated into the two fundamental parts of any web applications: `client` and `server`.

You will become very familiar with this project structure as you extend its current, basic functionality, to lengths limited only to your desire.

## Setting Things Up

This project, *and essentially every one you will ever work on*, depends on other code to work properly. Therefore, the first step is to install that external code called **dependencies**. For this, you'll first need to install Node.js (if you don't have it already).

Windows: [Install Node](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/the-best-way-to-install-node-js-on-a-windows-pc-4481156bf63e)


MacOS: [Install Node](https://nodesource.com/blog/installing-node-js-tutorial-using-nvm-on-mac-os-x-and-ubuntu/)

Once you have done this, you should have access to the **Node Package Manager (npm)**. You can verify this by typing `npm --version` or `npm -v` in your terminal. If you see a version number, you're good to go!

Next, run:
```
npm run init
```

You should see a progress bar 3 separate times, one after another. Once this completes, run:
```
npm run watch-project
```
This will start both the `client` and `server` to which you can navigate to
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the app running!

## Congratulations!
You now have a working project that you will be extending. We look forward to helping you all through this software development journey!
